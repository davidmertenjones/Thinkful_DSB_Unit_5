    "## State whether a survey would be the best option for answering each of the following questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Popularity of various Uber drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavioral study - a survey might tend to include only the strongest positive/negative sentiments about the drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* A grocery store wants to know how much people like strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla ice cream.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavioral study - a survey could work if there is an external incentive to take part in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Trojan wants to know whether their condoms are more popular among straight people or gay people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Survey - even as a survey, there may be sample bias, but without a survey, there is no data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recently, rental rates for HappyCars have increased by 30%, which is quite unusual. You want to find out why this is happening and how to keep the increase going.\n",
    "\n",
    "Survey - assuming other factors have been ruled out.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assessing the success rate of a new advertising campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavioral study - A/B test. A survey could be used to ascertain customer sentiment towards the survey, but looking at sales directly is probably better.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Measuring the effect of nurse/patient ratio on patient recovery rates in hospital wards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavioral study - a survey for either nurses or patients is likely to provide an incomplete picture. Here it is better to look at the big picture, and record data on patient recovery rates."
